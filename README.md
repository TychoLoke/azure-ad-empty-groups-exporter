# üöÄ Azure AD Empty Groups Exporter  

This **PowerShell script**, authored by **Tycho L√∂ke**, automates the process of identifying and exporting **empty groups** from **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** using the **Microsoft Graph API**.  

The results are saved to a **CSV file**, making it easy to analyze and clean up unused groups in your directory. Now includes support for identifying groups with **nested memberships** to prevent accidental deletions.

---

## üìå Features  
‚úÖ **Automated Empty Group Retrieval** ‚Äì Fetches all Azure AD groups and identifies those with **no members**.  
‚úÖ **Excludes Nested Memberships** ‚Äì Ensures groups that are members of other groups are excluded from the report.  
‚úÖ **Detailed Group Classification** ‚Äì Categorizes groups into types like **Microsoft 365**, **Security**, or **Distribution**.  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Updates** ‚Äì Displays progress as it processes each group.  
‚úÖ **Customizable Export Path** ‚Äì Save the report to a location of your choice.  
‚úÖ **Error Handling** ‚Äì Skips inaccessible groups and logs warnings without interrupting the script.

## üõ† Prerequisites  

Before running the script, ensure you meet the following requirements:  

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** ‚Äì Your account must be linked to an Azure AD tenant.  
- **Admin Role** ‚Äì Requires **Group.Read.All** or higher permissions in AAD.  
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module** ‚Äì Installed automatically by the script if missing.  
- **PowerShell Execution Policy** ‚Äì Must allow script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`).

## üöÄ How to Use  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Download the Script**  
Clone this repository or download the script file manually.  

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TychoLoke/azure-ad-empty-groups-exporter.git
cd azure-ad-empty-groups-exporter
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Run PowerShell as Administrator**  
- Open **PowerShell** with elevated permissions (`Run as Administrator`).  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Execute the Script**  
Run the script using:  

```powershell
.\Export-AzureAD-EmptyGroups.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Temp\EmptyGroups.csv"
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Authenticate with Microsoft Graph**  
- A **pop-up login window** will appear.
- Sign in with your **Global Admin** or **Group Administrator** credentials.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ What Happens Next?**  
‚úÖ The script **checks for required modules** and installs them if missing.  
‚úÖ It **connects to Microsoft Graph** via pop-up login.  
‚úÖ Retrieves **all Azure AD groups** and identifies empty groups (with no direct members or nested memberships).  
‚úÖ **Classifies each group** by type and compiles a report.  
‚úÖ Saves the report to the specified file path (e.g., `C:\Temp\EmptyGroups.csv`).

## üîé Notes  
- The script uses **`Microsoft.Graph.Groups`** instead of the full Microsoft Graph module to optimize performance.  
- It provides **progress updates** for long-running operations (e.g., processing thousands of groups).  
- The default export location can be customized using the `-OutputPath` parameter.  

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting  

### ‚ùå Module Not Found?  
Ensure you have an internet connection and sufficient permissions to install the `Microsoft.Graph` module.  

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
```

### ‚ùå Script Fails to Authenticate?  
Verify your account has **Global Admin** or **Group Administrator** privileges.  

### ‚ùå Script Hangs or Freezes?  
If processing thousands of groups, allow the script time to complete. Progress is displayed in the PowerShell window.
