# 🚀 Azure AD Empty Groups Exporter  

This **PowerShell script**, authored by **Tycho Löke**, automates the process of identifying and exporting **empty groups** from **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** using the **Microsoft Graph API**.  

The results are saved to a **CSV file**, making it easy to analyze and clean up unused groups in your directory. Now includes support for identifying groups with **nested memberships** to prevent accidental deletions.

---

## 📌 Features  
✅ **Automated Empty Group Retrieval** – Fetches all Azure AD groups and identifies those with **no members**.  
✅ **Excludes Nested Memberships** – Ensures groups that are members of other groups are excluded from the report.  
✅ **Detailed Group Classification** – Categorizes groups into types like **Microsoft 365**, **Security**, or **Distribution**.  
✅ **Real-Time Updates** – Displays progress as it processes each group.  
✅ **Customizable Export Path** – Save the report to a location of your choice.  
✅ **Error Handling** – Skips inaccessible groups and logs warnings without interrupting the script.

## 🛠 Prerequisites  

Before running the script, ensure you meet the following requirements:  

- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** – Your account must be linked to an Azure AD tenant.  
- **Admin Role** – Requires **Group.Read.All** or higher permissions in AAD.  
- **Microsoft Graph PowerShell Module** – Installed automatically by the script if missing.  
- **PowerShell Execution Policy** – Must allow script execution (`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`).

## 🚀 How to Use  

### **1️⃣ Download the Script**  
Clone this repository or download the script file manually.  

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/TychoLoke/azure-ad-empty-groups-exporter.git
cd azure-ad-empty-groups-exporter
```

### **2️⃣ Run PowerShell as Administrator**  
- Open **PowerShell** with elevated permissions (`Run as Administrator`).  

### **3️⃣ Execute the Script**  
Run the script using:  

```powershell
.\Export-AzureAD-EmptyGroups.ps1 -OutputPath "C:\Temp\EmptyGroups.csv"
```

### **4️⃣ Authenticate with Microsoft Graph**  
- A **pop-up login window** will appear.
- Sign in with your **Global Admin** or **Group Administrator** credentials.

### **5️⃣ What Happens Next?**  
✅ The script **checks for required modules** and installs them if missing.  
✅ It **connects to Microsoft Graph** via pop-up login.  
✅ Retrieves **all Azure AD groups** and identifies empty groups (with no direct members or nested memberships).  
✅ **Classifies each group** by type and compiles a report.  
✅ Saves the report to the specified file path (e.g., `C:\Temp\EmptyGroups.csv`).

## 🔎 Notes  
- The script uses **`Microsoft.Graph.Groups`** instead of the full Microsoft Graph module to optimize performance.  
- It provides **progress updates** for long-running operations (e.g., processing thousands of groups).  
- The default export location can be customized using the `-OutputPath` parameter.  

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting  

### ❌ Module Not Found?  
Ensure you have an internet connection and sufficient permissions to install the `Microsoft.Graph` module.  

```powershell
Install-Module Microsoft.Graph -Scope CurrentUser
```

### ❌ Script Fails to Authenticate?  
Verify your account has **Global Admin** or **Group Administrator** privileges.  

### ❌ Script Hangs or Freezes?  
If processing thousands of groups, allow the script time to complete. Progress is displayed in the PowerShell window.
